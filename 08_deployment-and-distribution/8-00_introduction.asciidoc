=== Introduction

You've spent all of this time developing your next big thing: what's
next but to ship it to the wild? Whether it is a product, internal
service, or library, the last (and most important) step is
delivering the fruits of your labor to your audience.

It's easy for developers to forget that code-complete is only the
beginning of an actual application's life cycle. A successful project
will spend much more time in production than it will in development,
and stability and maintainability are premium features.

This is a chapter all about really finishing your work and building
something that will run as painlessly as possible for years to
come. Be the task performance, logging, release, or long-term
maintenance, it's all important in shipping something that is truly
excellent. There is certainly a lot to worry about when your baby
finally leaves home; we hope these recipes help you get it right.
