=== Introduction

It's one thing to trust your code is correct today, but how will you
feel about it in a week? A month? A year? When you're long gone?
For this kind of trust, we write tests for our code. A well-written
suite of tests is a statement to yourself and to anyone that comes after
you: "This is how this application works, now and so long as this test
passes."

In addition to tests, several other tools have recently sprung up in
the Clojure space aimed at improving program reliability. Often, these
focus on validating that data looks as expected to guard programs
from receiving input they don't know how to handle. These solutions
range from optional static typing with algebraic types analyzed at
compile time, down to simple preconditions.((("reliability, improving", seealso="testing")))

Admittedly, testing is a bit of a hot-button topic in the Clojure
community right now. People are starting to question whether these tests are worthwhile, or if there's a better way to think about program verification. In recent years, techniques such as REPL-driven
development, property-based testing, and optional typing have all
popped up to fill perceived voids in the testing landscape.((("validation/verification", see="testing")))

This chapter covers all of the above. As much as we'd love to push the
envelope, nothing beats a good old-fashioned unit test suite from
time to time. At the same time, as we build more and more gargantuan
applications, it is clear that simple unit tests are not always
sufficient. We hope that regardless of your skill level or focus, you'll find new
tools to add to your testing arsenal in this chapter.
