Hoplon Contrib Libraries
========================

This is a collection of useful [Hoplon][1] libraries, packaged to be easily
incorporated into your own applications.

* UI kits
* Widget libraries
* CSS frameworks
* jQuery plugins
* Service API clients, and more!

## Usage

Just add them as dependencies to your project, and Hoplon will take care
of the rest! Check the `README` files for API info and usage examples.

## Contribute

Awesome! Pull requests are always welcome!

Some general guidelines to consider when putting together a new contrib
package:

* **Third-party JavaScript, CSS, and resources:** Put Hoplon code (i.e.
  ClojureScript namespaces and the like) in contrib libraries, not 3rd
  party JavaScript, CSS, or resources (images, etc.). If you need to
  include these things please create a [vendor][6] project containing
  the 3rd party code.

* **Resources:** Resources specific to your project (images, stylesheets,
  etc.) can be included by creating a `_hoplon` directory that is in your
  project's build classpath. These files will be emitted into the application's
  document root (so please try to avoid collisions by using unique names as
  much possible).

* **Project group id:** Use the `io.hoplon` group id, please. When we merge
  your pull request we'll push artifacts to [Clojars][2] for everyone to use.

* **Namespaces:** Please use the `hoplon.your-library` namespace format.
