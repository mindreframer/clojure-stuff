# Hoplon [![latest version][8]][4]

Hoplon is a set of tools and libraries for making web applications. Hoplon
provides a compiler for web application frontend development, and includes
the following libraries as dependencies to complete the stack:

* [Javelin][1]: a spreadsheet-like dataflow library for managing client
  state. Hoplon tightly integrates with Javelin to reactively bind DOM
  elements to the underlying Javelin cell graph.
* [Castra][2]: a full-featured RPC library for Clojure and
  ClojureScript, providing the serverside environment.
* [Cljson][3]: an efficient method for transferring Clojure/ClojureScript
  data between client and server. Castra uses cljson as the underlying
  transport protocol.

### Documentation

* [API Documentation][9]
* [Design Document][6] (early version)

### Demos

* [Hoplon demo applications repository][5]

### Example

```xml
<script type="text/hoplon">
  ;; Page declaration specifies output file path.
  (page "index.html")
  
  ;; definitions are optional
  (defn my-list [& items]
    (div
      :class "my-list"
      (apply ul (map #(li (div :class "my-list-item" %)) items))))

  (def clicks (cell 0))
</script>
    
<html>
  <head>
    <title>example page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Hoplon</h1>
    
    <!-- an HTML syntax call to the my-list function -->
    <my-list>
      <span>first thing</span>
      <span>second thing</span>
    </my-list>

    <!-- using dataflow to link DOM and Javelin cells -->
    <p><text>You've clicked ~{clicks} times, so far.</text></p>
    <button on-click="{{ #(swap! clicks inc) }}">click me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Or, equivalently:

```clojure
(page "index.html")

(defn my-list [& items]
  (div
    :class "my-list"
    (apply ul (map #(li (div :class "my-list-item" %)) items))))

(def clicks (cell 0))

(html
  (head
    (title "example page"))
  (body
    (h1 "Hello, Hoplon")

    (my-list
      (span "first thing")
      (span "second thing"))

    (p (text "You've clicked ~{clicks} times, so far."))
    (button :on-click #(swap! clicks inc) "click me")))
```
