=== Introduction

We've done a lot of work in the last few chapters, but clearly, the
rubber has to meet the road somewhere. How did we get all of this data
_into_ our Clojure programs, and more importantly, how do we get it
_out_? This chapter is all about input and output to a local
computer--the primary place where most applications' data hits the
road, so to speak.

There are a variety of modes and mediums for communicating with a
local machine. What do we communicate with, in what way, and in what
format? It's a little like the classic board game Clue: was it
plain text, in the console, with command-line arguments; or Clojure
data, in a file, as configuration data? In this chapter we'll explore
files, formats, and applications of both GUI and console flavors, to
name a few topics.

While it isn't possible for us to enumerate every possible
combination, it is our hope that this chapter will give you a strong
idea of what is possible. Handily enough, most good solutions in
Clojure _compose_; you should have little trouble sticking together
any number of recipes in this chapter to suit your needs.
