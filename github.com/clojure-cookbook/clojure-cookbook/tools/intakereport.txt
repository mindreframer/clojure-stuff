Resources
=========

** Intake PDFs: 
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake.pdf
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake_with_remarks.pdf

** Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs. 
   7 total. (0 are informal; 0 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** Syntax highlighting: applied to 921 out of 932 code listings.

** Note: I fixed syntax highlighting that wasn't working, but "[source,csv]" isn't supported by Pygments.  Prod, check in with the author about using something else. 

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.


Notes from Dan:
==================

This book is ready for intake.

Meg noted that the book has multiple authors with differing writing abilities. Please have the copyeditor watch for inconsistencies of
style.

Meg asked to have print versions for ClojureBridge (Feb 28). Not sure if it's possible. It's not a deal breaker on her part. The rough
schedule I made doesn't have it out in time.

Tools: see the author comment in the Preface (under "Chapter Listing") regarding rendering of cross references.

[We're still working on rendering cross references differently. --Tools]

Prod: I didn't see an Acknowledgements section. Better double check with the authors.

Please add boilerplate Sarai and Using Code sections.

[Done. --Tools]

Prod: watch for code blocks that don't have syntax highlighting. It could be that the particular author of that section didn't know how
to use the feature.

[Fixed syntax highlighting that wasn't working, but "[source,csv]" isn't supported by Pygments.  Prod, check in with the author about using something else. --Tools]

Prod: watch figure sizes. Some are too big as they are appearing initially.

I see quite a few long code lines.

Figure 9-1 is way too small in the incoming PDF. I can't tell whether illustrations will need to redraw it or not. Prod: alert!

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Chris
