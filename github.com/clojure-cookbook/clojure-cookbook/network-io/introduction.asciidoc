=== Introduction

More and more these days it seems like every system we build has to
talk to something, somewhere footnote:[In fact,
http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2482856[There's Just No Getting
around It: You're Building a Distributed System].]. Like
<<ch_local_io>>, we'd hardly be doing anything at all if we didn't
actually talk with some other computers over some kind of network.

This chapter covers all of the normal remote communication modes you would
expect--HTTP, TCP, UDP and the like--as well as some relative newcomers footnote:[As
Australian songwriter Peter Allen so aptly put it: "Everything old
is new again."] like  message-oriented architectures.
