=== Introduction

Web application development is the breadwinner for many languages
nowadays; Clojure is no exception. In the annual
http://bit.ly/clojure-survey-2013[2013
State of Clojure Survey], web development ranked first for the
question, "In which domains are you applying Clojure and/or
ClojureScript?"

Much of the Clojure web development community today centers around
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring], an HTTP server library very
much akin to Ruby's http://rack.github.io/[Rack]. Starting with the
introduction to Ring in <<sec_webapps_ring_introduction>>, you'll find
a full complement of recipes here that will get you up to speed in no time.

Following Ring, the chapter takes a tour of the other Clojure web
development ecosystems available at the time of writing, covering a few
templating and HTML-manipulation libraries and a number of alternative
web frameworks.
