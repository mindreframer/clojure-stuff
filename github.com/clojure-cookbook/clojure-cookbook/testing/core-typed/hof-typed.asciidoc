=== Type Checking Higher-order Functions with +core.typed+
[role="byline"]
by Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant

==== Problem

Clojure strongly encourages higher-order functions, but tools for
verifying their use focus on runtime verification. You want earlier
feedback: compile time.

==== Solution

Use +core.typed+ to type check higher-order functions.

To follow along with this recipe, create a file _core_typed_samples.clj_
and start a REPL using +lein-try+:

[source,shell]
----
$ touch core_typed_samples.clj
$ lein try org.clojure/core.typed
----

[NOTE]
====
This recipe is a little different than others because +core.typed+ uses
on-disk files to check namespaces.
====

To demonstrate ++core.typed++'s abilities, define a typed higher-order
function +hash-of?+, which accepts two predicates and returns a new
predicate. Use +clojure.core.typed/fn>+ to return an anonymous
function with type annotations attached.

._core_typed_samples.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
(ns core-typed-samples
  (:require [clojure.core.typed :refer [ann fn>] :as t]))

(ann hash-of? [[Any -> Any] [Any -> Any] -> [Any -> Any]])
(defn hash-of? [ks? vs?]
  (fn> [m :- Any]
    (when (map? m)
      (and (every? ks? (keys m))
           (every? ks? (vals m))))))
----

Each argument to +hash-of?+ has type `[Any -> Any]`: a single argument
function taking anything and returning anything.

Verifying +hash-of?+ confirms that the type annotations above are correct.

[source,shell]
-----
user=> (require '[clojure.core.typed :as t])
user=> (t/check-ns 'core-typed-samples)
# ...
:ok
-----

Using the +clojure.core.typed/cf+ macro you can type check individual
forms at the REPL (or under test). Invoking +hash-of?+ with two
predicates verifies as expected, outputting the resulting type.

[source,shell]
-----
user=> (require '[core-typed-samples :refer [hash-of?]])
user=> (t/cf (hash-of? number? number?))
(Fn [Any -> Any])
-----

Passing `+` as a predicate, however, is a type error.

[source,shell]
-----
user=> (t/cf (hash-of? + number?))
Type Error (user:1:7) Type mismatch:

Expected:       (Fn [Any -> Any])

Actual:         (Fn [t/AnyInteger * -> t/AnyInteger]
                    [java.lang.Number * -> java.lang.Number])

-----

Because +hash-of?+ takes a function with an +Any+ parameter and `+`
takes at most a +Number+ this is a type error.

==== Discussion

While Clojure's built-in pre/post conditions are useful for defining
anonymous functions that fail fast, these checks only provide feedback
at runtime. Why not type-check our higher-order functions as well?
++core.typed++'s type checking abilities aren't limited to only data
types--it can also type-check functions as types themselves.

By writing returning anonymous functions created with the
+clojure.core.typed/fn>+ form instead of +fn+, it is possible to
annotate function objects with ++core.typed++'s rich type-checking system.
When defining functions with +fn>+, annotate types to its arguments
with the +:-+ operator. For example, +(t/fn> [m :- Map] ...)+ would
indicate an anonymous function that accepted a +Map+ as its sole
argument.

Beyond definition, it can also be useful to check the types of forms
at the REPL. The `clojure.core.typed/cf` macro is a versatile,
REPL-oriented tool for on-demand type checking. This proves useful not
only for checking your code, but investigating built-in functions.
Invoking +cf+ on any of Clojure' higher-order functions reveals their
type signatures.

[source,shell]
-----
user=> (t/cf iterate)
(All [x] 
  (Fn [(Fn [x -> x]) x -> (clojure.lang.LazySeq x)]))
-----

The +All+ around ++iterate++'s type indicates that it is _polymorphic_
in +x+. It reads, "for all types x, takes a function that accepts an x
and returns an x, and takes an x, and returns a lazy sequence of x".

The +cf+ macro can also detect when the wrong number of arguments are
being passed to a function returned by another function.

[source,shell]
-----
user=> (t/cf (fn [] ((hash-of? + number?))))
Type Error (user:1:15) Type mismatch:

Expected:       (Fn [Any -> Any])

Actual:         (Fn [t/AnyInteger * -> t/AnyInteger]
                    [java.lang.Number * -> java.lang.Number])
in: ((core-typed-samples/hash-of? clojure.core/+ clojure.core/number?))


Type Error (user:1:14) Wrong number of arguments, expected 1 fixed
parameters, and got 0 for function [Any -> Any] and arguments []
in: ((core-typed-samples/hash-of? clojure.core/+ clojure.core/number?))

[NOTE]
====
In this experiment, the faulty invocation of +hash-of?+ is wrapped in
an anonymous function. At the time of this writing, +core.typed+
evaluates code before it type checks it.

Without this, the raw invocation `((hash-of? + number?))` would return
a regular Clojure +ArityException+.
