=== Thoroughly Testing by Randomizing Inputs
[role="byline"]
by Luke VanderHart

==== Problem

You want to test a function using randomly generated inputs to ensure
that it works in all possible scenarios.

==== Solution

Use the +test.generative+ library to specify a function's inputs, and
test it across random generated values.

To follow along with this recipe, start a REPL using +lein-try+:

[source,shell]
----
$ lein try org.clojure/test.generative "0.5.0"
----

Say you are trying to test the following function, which calculates
the arithmatic mean of all the numbers in a sequence.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn mean
  "Calculate the mean of the numbers in a sequence"
  [s]
  (/ (reduce + s) (count s)))
----


The following +test.generative+ code then defines a _specification_ for
the +mean+ function:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.test.generative :as t]
         '[clojure.test.generative.runner :as r]
         '[clojure.data.generators :as gen])

(defn number
  "Returns a random number, of a random type"
  []
  (gen/one-of gen/byte
              gen/short
              gen/int
              gen/long
              gen/float
              gen/double))

(defn seq-of-numbers
  "Returns a list, seq or set of numbers"
  []
  (gen/one-of (gen/list number)
              (gen/set number)
              (gen/vec number)))

(t/defspec mean-spec
  mean
  [^example.generative-tests/seq-of-numbers arg]
  (assert (number? %)))
----

To run the +mean-spec+ specification, invoke the +run+ function in the
+clojure.test.generative.runner+ namespace, passing in the number of
threads upon which to run the simulation, the number of milliseconds
to run, and the _var_ referring to a spec.

Running the above example at the REPL:

[source,clojure]
----
(r/run 2 5000 #'example.generative-tests/mean-spec)
;; -> clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Generative test failed
----

This shows the behavior when the generative test fails. The exact
details of the failure are returned as the data of a Clojure
information-bearing exception; to retrieve it you must retrieve an
instance of the exception itself and call +ex-data+ on it to return
the data map.

In the REPL, if you didn't explicitly catch the exception, you can use
the special +*e+ symbol to retrieve the most recent exception. Calling
+ex-data+ on it returns information on the test case that provoked the
error:

[source,clojure]
----
(ex-data *e)
;; -> {:exception #<ArithmeticException java.lang.ArithmeticException: 
;;     Divide by zero>, :iter 7, :seed -875080314,
;;     :example.generative-tests/mean-spec, :input [#{}]}
----

This states that after only seven iterations, using the random number
seed -875080314, the function under test was passed +#{}+ as input and threw a divide by zero error.

Once highlighted in this way, the problem is easy to see; the +mean+
function will divide by zero if +(count s)+ is zero. Fix the bug by
rewriting the +mean+ function to handle that case:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn mean
  [s]
  (if (zero? (count s))
    0
    (/ (reduce + 1.0 s) (count s))))
----

Rerunning now shows a passing test:

[source,clojure]
----
(r/run 2 5000 #'example.generative-tests/mean-spec)
;; -> {:iter 3931, :seed -1495229764, :test testgen-test.core/mean-spec}
;;    {:iter 3909, :seed -1154113663, :test testgen-test.core/mean-spec}
----

This output indicates that over the allotted five seconds, two threads
ran about 3900 iterations of the test each, and did not encounter any
errors or assertion failures.

==== Discussion

There are two key parts of the test definition above: the +defspec+
form itself, which defines the generative test, and functions used to
generate random data. In this case, the data generator functions are
built from primitive data generation functions found in the
+clojure.data.generators+ namespace.

Generator functions take no arguments, and return a random
value. Different functions produce different types of data. The
+clojure.data.generators+ namespace contains generator functions for
all of Clojure's primitive types, as well as collections. It also
contains functions for randomly choosing from a set of options; the
+one-of+ function used above, for example, takes a number of generator
functions and chooses a value from one at random.

The +defspec+ macro takes three types of forms: a function to put
under test, an _argument specification_ and a _body_ containing one or
more assertion forms.

The function under test is simply the function to call. Over the
course of the generative test it will be called many times, each time
with different values.

The argument specification is a vector of arguments names, and should
match the signature of the function under test. Each argument should
have _metadata_ attached. Specifically, it should have a +:tag+
metadata key, mapped to the fully qualified name of a generator
function. Each time the test driver calls the function, it will use a
random value for each argument pulled from its corresponding generator
function.

.Why ++:tag++?
****
You may find the use of +:tag+ metadata may be a bit
confusing. Normally, +:tag+ is a type hint and returns a JVM
_class_. In +test.generative+, it should be a _function_ that can return
any type of value you want to pass to the function under test.

The motivation for reusing +:tag+ in this way is mostly
historical. +test.generative+ is largely inspired by a library called
QuickCheck, which is written in Haskell. Because Haskell is strongly
and statically typed, QuickCheck truly can use the type signature as
sufficient information on how to generate input data.

The link isn't quite as strong in Clojure, and arguably is more
confusing than helpful. Just remember that, in the context of
+test.generative+, +:tag+ refers not to the actual system type, but to a
function that returns an object of the type(s) you want to pass to the
function to test.
****

The body of a +defspec+ simply contains expressions that may throw an
exception if some condition is not met. It is executed on each
iteration of the test, with the instantiated arguments available, and
with the return value of the function under test bound to +%+. This
example merely has a single assertion that the result is a number, for
brevity, but you can have any number of assertions executing arbitrary
checks.

An interesting difference between +test.generative+ and traditional
unit tests is that rather than specifying what tests to run, and
having them take as long as they do, in +test.generative+ you specify
how long to run, and the system will run as many random permutations
of the test as it can fit into that time. This has the property of
keeping test run times deterministic, while allowing you to trade off
speed and comperehensiveness depending on the situation. For example,
you might have tests run for 5 seconds in development, but thoroughly
hammer the system for an hour every night on the CI server, allowing
you to find that (literally) 1-in-a-million bug.

===== Running generative tests

While developing tests, running from the REPL is usually the most
convenient. However, there are many other scenarios (such as commit
hooks or a continuous integration server) where running tests from the
command line is required. For this purpose, +test.generative+ provides a
+-main+ function in the +clojure.test.generative.runner+ namespace
that takes as command line argument one or more directories where
generative tests can be found. It searches all the Clojure namespaces
in those locations for generative testing specifications, and executes
them.

For example, if you've placed your generative tests in a
+tests/generative+ directory inside a Leiningen project, you could
execute tests by running the following at the shell, from your
project's root directory:

[source,shell]
----
lein run -m clojure.test.generative.runner tests/generative
----

If you want to control the intensity of the test run, you can adjust
the number of concurrent threads and the length of the run using the
+clojure.test.generative.threads+ and +clojure.test.generative.msec+
JVM system properties. Using leiningen, you must set these options in
the +:jvm-opts+ key in _project.clj_ like so:

+clojure.test.generative.runner/-main+ will pick up any parameters
provided in this way, and run accordingly.
