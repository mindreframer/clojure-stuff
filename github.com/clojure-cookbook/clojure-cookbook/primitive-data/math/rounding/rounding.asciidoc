=== Truncating and Rounding Numbers
[role="byline"]
by Ryan Neufeld

==== Problem

You need to truncate or round a decimal number to a lower precision number.

==== Solution

If the integer portion of a number is all you are concerned with, use
+int+ to coerce a number to an integer. Of course, this completely
discards any decimal places without performing any rounding.

[source,clojure]
----
(int 2.0001)
;; -> 2

(int 2.999999999)
;; -> 2
----

If you still value some level of precision then rounding is probably
what you're after. You can use +Math/round+ to perform simple
rounding.

[source,clojure]
----
(Math/round 2.0001)
;; -> 2

(Math/round 2.999)
;; -> 3

;; This is equivalent to:
(int (+ 2.99 0.5))
;; -> 3
----

If you want to perform an unbalanced rounding, such as unconditionally
"rounding up" or "rounding down" then you should use +Math/ceil+ or
+Math/floor+ respectively.

[source,clojure]
----
(Math/ceil 2.0001)
;; -> 3.0

(Math/floor 2.999)
;; -> 2.0
----

You'll notice these functions return decimal numbers. Wrap calls to
+ceil+ or +floor+ in +int+ to return an integer.

==== Discussion

One of the most simple ways to "round" numbers is truncation. +int+ will
do this for you, coercing floating-point numbers to integers by simply
chopping off any trailing decimal places. This isn't necessarily
mathematically correct, but it is certainly convenient if it is
accurate enough for the problem at hand.

+Math/round+ is the next step up in rounding technology. Like many
other primitive manipulation functions in Clojure the language prefers
*not* to re-invent the wheel. +Math/round+ is a Java function that
rounds by adding 1/2 to a number before dropping decimal places
similarly to +int+.

For more advanced rounding, such as controlling number of decimal
places or complex rounding modes, you may need to resort to using
+with-precision+ function. You likely already know +BigDecimal+
numbers are backed by Java classes, but you might not have know that
Java exposes a number of knobs for tweaking +BigDecimal+ calculations;
+with-precision+ exposes these knobs.

+with-precision+ is a macro that accepts a +BigDecimal+ "precision"
mode and any number of expressions, executing those expressions in a
+BigDecimal+ context tuned to that precision. So what does precision
look like? Well, it's a little strange. The most basic precision is
simple a positive integer "scale" value - this value specifies the
number decimal places to work with. More complex precisions involve a
+:rounding+ value, specified like a key-value pair like +:rounding FLOOR+ (this *is* a macro
of course, so why not!?) When not specified the default rounding mode
is +HALF_UP+, but any of the values +CEILING+, +FLOOR+, +HALF_UP+,
+HALF_DOWN+, +HALF_EVEN+, +UP+, +DOWN+ or +UNNECESSARY+ are allowed.
See
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html[RoundingMode]
for more detailed descriptions of each mode.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-precision 3 (/ 7M 9))
;; -> 0.778M

(with-precision 1 (/ 7M 9))
;; -> 0.8M

(with-precision 1 :rounding FLOOR (/ 7M 9))
;; -> 0.7M
----

One notable "gotcha" with +with-precision+ is that it only changes the
behavior of +BigDecimal+ arithmetic, leaving regular arithmetic
unchanged. You'll either have to introduce +BigDecimal+ values into
your expressions with literal values (+3M+) or by means of the
+bigdec+ function.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-precision 3 (/ 1 3))
;; -> 1/3

(with-precision 3 (/ (bigdec 1) 3))
;; -> 0.333M
----
