=== Performing Bitwise Operations
[role="byline"]
by Ryan Neufeld

==== Problem

You need to perform bitwise operations on numbers.

==== Solution

Bitwise operations aren't quite as commonly used in high-level
languages (like Clojure) as they are in systems languages like C or
C\+\+, but the techniques learned in those systems languages can still
be useful. Clojure exposes a number of bitwise operations in its core
namespace, all prefixed with +bit-+.

One place bitwise operations really shine is in compressing a large
number of binary flags into a single value.

[source,clojure]
----
;; Modelling a subset of Unix filesystem flags in a single integer
(def fs-flags [:owner-read :owner-write :group-read :group-write :global-read :global-write])

;; Fold flags into a map of flag->bit
(def bitmap (zipmap fs-flags
                    (map (partial bit-shift-left 1) (range))))
;; -> {:owner-read 1, :owner-write 2, :group-read 4, ...}

(defn permissions-int [& flags]
  (reduce bit-or 0 (map bitmap flags)))

(def owner-only (permissions-int :owner-read :owner-write))
(Integer/toBinaryString owner-only)
;; -> "11"

(def read-only (permissions-int :owner-read :group-read :global-read))
(Integer/toBinaryString read-only)
;; -> "10101"

(defn able-to? [permissions flag]
  (not= 0 (bit-and permissions (bitmap flag))))

(able-to? read-only :global-read)  ;; -> true
(able-to? read-only :global-write) ;; -> false

==== Discussion

Clojure provides a full complement of bitwise operations in its core
library. This includes 'and', 'or', their negations and shifts, to name a few.

When working with bitwise operations it can often be necessary to view
the binary representation of an integer. Java's
+Integer/toBinaryString+ can conveniently print out a binary
representation of a number. 

Interestingly enough, core also includes a +bit-set+ and +bit-test+.
These two operations set or test an individual bit position in an
integer. Instead of working in multiples of two as is necessary for
operations like +bit-and+, you can operate by the *index* of the flag
you're interested in. This drastically simplifies the above example.

(def bitmap (zipmap fs-flags
                    (map #(.indexOf fs-flags %) fs-flags)))

(def no-permissions 0)
(def owner-read (bit-set no-permissions (:owner-read bitmap)))

(Integer/toBinaryString owner-read)
;; -> "1"

;; Granting global permissions...
(def anything (reduce #(bit-set %1 (bitmap %2)) no-permissions fs-flags))
(Integer/toBinaryString anything)
;; -> "111111"
