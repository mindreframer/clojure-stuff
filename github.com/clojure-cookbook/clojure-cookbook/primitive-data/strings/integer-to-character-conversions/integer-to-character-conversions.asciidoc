=== Converting Between Characters and Integers
[role="byline"]
by Ryan Neufeld

==== Problem

You need to convert characters to their respective unicode code points
(as integer values) or vice versa.

==== Solution

Use the +int+ function to convert a character to its integer value.

[source,clojure]
----
(int \a)
;; -> 97

(int \ø)
;; -> 248

(int \α) ; greek letter alpha
;; -> 945

(int \u03B1) ; greek letter alpha (by code point)
;; -> 945

(map int "Hello, world!")
;; -> (72 101 108 108 111 44 32 119 111 114 108 100 33)
----

Use the +char+ function to return a character corresponding to the
code point specified by the integer.

[source,clojure]
----
(char 97)
;; -> \a

(char 125)
;; -> \}

(char 945)
;; -> \α

(reduce #(str %1 (char %2))
        ""
        [115 101 99 114 101 116 32 109 101 115 115 97 103 101 115])
;; -> "secret messages"
----

==== Discussion

Clojure inherits the JVM's robust Unicode support. All strings are
UTF-16 strings, and all characters are unicode
characters. Conveniently, the first 256 Unicode code points are
identical to ASCII, which makes standard ASCII text easy to work
with. However, Clojure (and Java) do not actually privilege ASCII in
any way the 1:1 correspondence between characters and integers
indicating code points continues all the way up through the Unicode space.

For example, the expression +(map char (range 0x0410 0x042F))+ prints
out all the Cyrillic capital letters, which happen to lie on that
range on the Unicode spectrum:

[source,clojure]
----
(\А \Б \В \Г \Д \Е \Ж \З \И \Й \К \Л \М \Н \О \П \Р \С \Т \У \Ф
\Х \Ц \Ч \Ш \Щ \Ъ \Ы \Ь \Э \Ю)
----

The +char+ and +int+ functions are useful primarily for coercing a
number into either an instance of +java.lang.Integer+ or
+java.lang.Character+. Both ++Integer++s and ++Character++s are,
ultimately, encoded as numbers, although +Character+'s support
additional text-related methods, and cannot be used in mathematic
expressions without first being converted to a true numeric type.
