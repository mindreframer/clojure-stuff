=== Acknowledgments

This book would not have been possible without the
selfless contributions of many within the Clojure community. Over 65
Clojurists rose to the occasion, submitting recipes, proofreading, and
offering their input on the direction of the book. Ultimately, this is
the community's book--we're just honored to have been able to help put
it together. Those contributors are:

Our biggest contributors also deserve special thanks: Adam
Bard, Alan Busby, Alex Robbins, Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant, Dmitri Sotnikov,
John Cromartie, John Jacobsen, Robert Stuttaford, Stefan Karlsson, and
Tom Hicks. All together, these outstanding individuals contributed
almost a third of the book's recipes.

Thanks also to our technical reviewers, Alex Robbins, Travis Vachon, and
Thomas Hicks. These fine gentlemen scoured the book for technical
errors in record time, in the 11th hour no less. Where a regular
technical reviewer would merely submit textual descriptions of
problems, these folks went above and beyond, often submitting pull
requests _fixing_ the very errors they were reporting. All in all,
they were a pleasure to work with and the book is much better because
of their involvement.

Finally, thanks to our employer, Cognitect, for giving us time to work
on the book, and to all of our colleagues who offered advice, feedback,
and best of all, more recipes!

==== Ryan Neufeld

First, a huge thanks to Luke. It was Luke who originally pitched the
idea for the book, and I'm very grateful that he extended an
invitation for me to join him in authoring it. They say the best way
to learn something is to write a book on it--this couldn't be any
closer to the truth. Working on the book has really rounded out my
Clojure skills and taken them to the next level.

And, most importantly, I have to thank my family for putting up with me
through the process of writing the book. Getting this thing off the
ground has been a Herculean task and I couldn't have done it without
the love and support of my wife Jackie and daughter Elody. If it
hadn't been for the hundreds upon hundreds of hours of evenings,
weekends, and vacation time I usurped from them, I wouldn't have been
able to write this book.

==== Luke VanderHart

Most of all, I'd like to thank my coauthor Ryan, who worked incredibly
hard to make the book happen.

Also, all of my coworkers at Cognitect provided lots of thoughts and
ideas, and most importantly were a sounding board for the many
questions that arose during the writing and editing process. Many
thanks for that, as well as for providing the opportunity to write
code in Clojure all day, every day.
