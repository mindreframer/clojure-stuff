=== Setting the Value at an Index
[role="byline"]
by Luke VanderHart

==== Problem

Given a vector, you would like to obtain a new vector with a different
value at a particular index.

==== Solution

Use +assoc+ to set the value at a particular index.

[source,clojure]
----
(assoc [:a :b :c ] 1 :x)
;; -> [:a :x :c]
----

+assoc+ can also be used to set multiple indexes at the same time, by
providing additional index/value pairs.

[source,clojure]
----
(assoc [:a :b :c ] 1 :x 2 :y)
;; -> [:a :x :y]
----

==== Discussion

As you may have noticed, +assoc+ is the same function used to set the
value of keys in a map. This is because vectors, like maps, are
associative and implement the same interface
(+clojure.lang.Associative+), which is what +assoc+ uses under the
hood.

Unlike maps, however, the keys used when using +assoc+ on a vector
must be integer indexes within the range of the vector. Attempting to
use a non-integer key will cause an +IllegalArgumentException+, and
attempting to +assoc+ an index greater than one more than the size of
the vector  will throw a +IndexOutOfBoundsException+.

Note that it *is* possible to +assoc+ to an index 1 greater than the
current size of the vector, this will have the result of appending the item to the end. (see <<sec_adding_to_a_vector>>).
