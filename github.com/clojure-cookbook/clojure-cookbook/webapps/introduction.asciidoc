=== Introduction

Web application development is the bread-winner for many languages
nowadays; Clojure is no exception to this. In the annual
http://cemerick.com/2013/11/18/results-of-the-2013-state-of-clojure-clojurescript-survey/[2013
State of Clojure Survery] "Web Development" ranked first for the
question: "In which domains are you applying Clojure and/or
ClojureScript?"

Much of the Clojure web development community today centers around
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring], a HTTP server library very
much akin to Ruby's http://rack.github.io/[Rack]. Starting with the
introduction to Ring in <<sec_webapps_ring_introduction>> you'll find
a full complement of recipes that will get you up to speed in no time.

Following Ring, the chapter takes a tour of the other the Clojure web
development ecosystems as of the date of publication, covering a few
templating and HTML-manipulation libraries and a number of alternative
web frameworks.
