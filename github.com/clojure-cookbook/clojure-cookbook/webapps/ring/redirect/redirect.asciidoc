=== Performing HTTP Redirects with Ring
[role="byline"]
by Craig McDaniel

==== Problem

In a Ring application, you need to return a HTTP response code that will redirect the browser to another URL.

==== Solution

To redirect a Ring request, use the +redirect+ function in the +ring.util.response+ namespace.

To follow along with this recipe, clone the _https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/ringtest_ repository and overwrite _src/ringtest.clj_.

._src/ringtest.clj_
[source, clojure]
----
(ns ringtest
  (:require
   [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]
   [ring.util.response :as response]))

(defn redirect-to-github
  "A handler that redirects all requests"
  [req]
  (response/redirect "http://github.com/"))

(defn -main []
  ;; Run the server on port 3000
  (jetty/run-jetty redirect-to-github {:port 3000}))
----

==== Discussion

The +ring.util.response+ namespace contains a function for redirecting to a URL. This URL can be generated dynamically from the request map (using parameters from wrap-params, headers, etc.). Underneath, this function simply creates a response map with a 302 +:status+ value and a "Location" header containing the URL to redirect to.

According to the HTTP specification, if the response method is a POST, PUT, or DELETE, it should be assumed that the server received the request, and the client should issue a GET request to the URL in the Location header. This is an important caveat when writing REST services. Fortunately, the specification provides a 307 status code, which should signal to clients that the request should be redirected to the new Location using the original method and body. To do this, simply return a response map in the handler function like so:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn redirect-to-github
  [req]
  {:status 307
   :headers {"Location" "http://github.com"}
   :body ""})
