=== Introduction

More and more these days, it seems like every system we build has to
talk to something, somewhere.footnote:[In fact, http://bit.ly/no-getting-around["There's Just No Getting
around It: You're Building a Distributed System"].] We'd hardly be doing anything if we didn't
actually talk with some other computers over some kind of network.

This chapter covers all of the normal remote communication modes you would
expect--HTTP, TCP, UDP, and the like--as well as some relative newcomersfootnote:[As
Australian songwriter Peter Allen so aptly put it: "Everything old
is new again."] like  message-oriented architectures.
