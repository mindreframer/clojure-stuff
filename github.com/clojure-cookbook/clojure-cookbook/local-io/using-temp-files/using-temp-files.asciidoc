=== Using Temporary Files
[role="byline"]
by Alan Busby

==== Problem

You want to use a temporary file on the local file system.

==== Solution

Use the static method +createTempFile+ of Java's built-in
+java.io.File+ clas to create a temporary file in the default
temporary-file directory of the JVM, with the provided prefix and
suffix.

[source,clojure]
----
(def my-temp-file (java.io.File/createTempFile "filename" ".txt"))
----

You can then write to the temporary file like you would to any other
instance of +java.io.File+:

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [file (clojure.java.io/writer my-temp-file)]
  (binding [*out* file]
    (println "Example output.")))
----

==== Discussion

Temporary files are often quite useful to interact with other programs
that prefer a file-based API. Using +createTempFile+ is important to
ensure that temporary files are placed in an appropriate location on
the file system, which can differ based on the operating system being
used.

To get the full path and filename for the created temporary file:

[source,clojure]
----
(.getAbsolutePath my-temp-file)
----

You can use the +File.deleteOnExit+ method to mark the temporary file
to be deleted automatically when the JVM exits.

[source,clojure]
----
(.deleteOnExit my-temp-file)
----

Note that the file is not actually deleted until the JVM terminates,
and may not be deleted if the process crashes or exits abnormally. It
is good practice to delete the temp files immediately when they are no
longer being used:

[source,clojure]
----
(.delete my-temp-file)
----
