=== Creating a List from an Existing Data Structure
[role="byline"]
by Luke VanderHart

==== Problem

You have an existing sequential data structure that you would like to
convert into a list as its concrete data type.(((lists, converting existing structure to)))

==== Solution

The easiest solution is: don't. Having a concrete list provides little
or no advantage over simply using the sequence abstraction directly on
your existing data, and for large data structures, conversion can be
expensive.((("sequence abstraction", "vs. concrete lists")))

If you do know that you need an explicit conversion of the concrete
data structure, there are two ways to do it.(((functions, list)))(((functions, apply)))

First, you could use the +apply+ function to call the +list+ function,
passing it your existing data structure as its arguments:

[source,clojure]
----
(apply list [1 2 3 4 5])
;; -> (1 2 3 4 5)
----

Alternatively, you could use the +into+ function to repeatedly conjoin(((functions, into)))
elements from your original data onto a list. Note, however, that
this approach has the effect of reversing the order of the original
collection:

[source,clojure]
----
(into '() [1 2 3 4 5])
;; -> (5 4 3 2 1)
----

==== Discussion

These two approaches are both viable choices. However, what actually
happens in each case is very different.

When using +apply+, you are actually invoking the +list+ function with
however many arguments are in the data structure. This may sound
strange, particularly if the data structure contains millions of
items. What does it mean to invoke a function with a million
arguments? How does that even work, given that the JVM limits methods
to 255 arguments (see the http://bit.ly/jvm-class-file-format[JVM
class file specification])?

As it turns out, functions with variadic arguments (such as +list+)
are handled in a somewhat special way: the argument list is passed in
as a sequence. +apply+ knows this and passes this sequence view of the
original structure directly through to the receiving function. This is
why it works; there is never actually a JVM method invocation with a
million arguments.(((variadic arguments)))((("arguments, variadic")))

+into+ works quite differently: it takes two arguments, the first
being a data structure and the second being a sequence. It then
repeatedly conjoins items from the sequence onto the data structure
provided using the +conj+ function (discussed in greater detail
elsewhere). This is why the sequence is reversed; items are always
pulled from the front of the sequence, but +conj+ on a list _prepends_
the element being added. Therefore, the first element in the input
sequence will end up being the last item in the list, and so on.((("functions", "conj", id="ix_Fconj", range="startofrange")))

So why ever choose +into+ over +apply+, given that it reverses the
order? Speed. +into+ utilizes Clojure _transients_, which provide a
considerable performance improvement. On the author's machine,
converting a million-item vector to a list using +apply+ took an
average of 750 milliseconds, while using +into+ took about half that
time, for an average of 350 milliseconds. Of course, the list was in
reverse order, and reversing either the input or the output negates
the speed advantage. In the end, +into+ is only advantageous in
situations where a reversed order is acceptable.(((Clojure, transients)))(((transients)))
