# Light Table ClojureScript Tutorial

An introduction to the
[ClojureScript](http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) programming
language aimed at [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com) users. If you have
an old version of Light Table, you may need to upgrade to 0.6.X or newer.

Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org). You can then open
`lt-cljs-tutorial.cljs` in Light Table and evaluate it interactively
by adding a Light Table UI connection as explained in the tutorial.

I hope this can be a kind of ClojureScript wiki of sorts for Light
Table users.  Pull requests welcome.

For users of editors/IDEs supporting [nREPL][1] there is
[a port of this tutorial][2] targeting those development environments
as well.
