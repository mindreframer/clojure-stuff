  "A Graph is a simple, declarative way to define a composition of functions that is
   easy to define, modify, execute, test, and monitor.

   This blog post provides a high-level overview of Graph and its benefits:
   http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2012/10/1/prismatics-graph-at-strange-loop.html

   Concretely, a Graph specification is just a Clojure (nested) map with keyword keys
   and keyword functions at the leaves.

   A Graph is defined recursively as either:
     1. a keyword function (i.e., fn satisfying PFnk), or
     2. a Clojure map from keywords to (sub)graphs.

   A Graph is a declarative specification of a single keyword function that
   produces a map output, where each value in the output is produced by executing
   the corresponding keyword function in the Graph.  The inputs to the keyword
   function are given by the outputs of other nodes in the graph with matching
   keywords (mimicking lexical scope in the case of nested maps), or failing that,
   from keywords in the input map.

   For more details and examples of Graphs, see test/plumbing/graph_examples_test.clj."

   order will be computed (an error will be thrown for cyclic specifications),
