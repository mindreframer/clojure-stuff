(ns plumbing.fnk.impl
  "Core utilities for parsing our 'fnk'-style binding syntax.
   Documented and tested through the actual 'letk','fnk', and 'defnk'
   macros in plumbing.core.

   The core entry points into this namespace are 'letk*' and 'fnk*',
   which parse the new binding syntax and generate fnk bodies,
   respectively.

   For efficiency, two different methods of generating fnk bodies are
   used.  If the fnk takes a fixed set of arguments (i.e., no & or
   :as), then a 'positional' version of the fnk that is called like an
   ordinary Clojure fn (e.g., (f a b) rather than (f {:a a :b b}) is
   generated as an implementation detail, and stored in metadata of
   the actual keyword fnk (which is just a thin wrapper around the
   positional version).  If '& or :as are used, no such positional
   function is generated.

   The advantage of these 'positional' functions is that they can be
   accessed using 'efficient-call-forms' or 'positional-fn' to call
   the fnk without incurring the overhead of producing and then
   destructuring a top-level map.  See plumbing.graph.positional for
   an example use."

   IFn/PFnk for these arguments.

   For efficiency, two different methods of generating fnk bodies are
   used.  If the fnk takes a fixed set of arguments (i.e., no & or
   :as), then a 'positional' version of the fnk that is called like an
   ordinary Clojure fn (e.g., (f a b) rather than (f {:a a :b b}) is
   generated as an implementation detail, and stored in metadata of
   the actual keyword fnk (which is just a thin wrapper around the
   positional version).  If '& or :as are used, no such positional
   function is generated."
