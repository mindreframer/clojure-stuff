=== Handling Cookies with Ring
[role="byline"]
by Adam Bard

==== Problem

Your web application needs to read or set cookies on the user's browser (for example, to remember a user's name.)

==== Solution

Use the `ring.middleware.cookies/wrap-cookies` middleware to add cookies to your requests.

To follow along with this recipe, clone the _https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/ringtest_ repository and overwrite _src/ringtest.clj_.

._src/ringtest.clj_
[source, clojure]
----
(ns ringtest
  (:require
    [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]
    [ring.middleware.cookies :refer [wrap-cookies]]
    [ring.middleware.params :refer [wrap-params]]))

(defn set-name-form
  "A response showing a form for the user to enter their name."
  []
  {:body "<html><form action=''>Name: <input type='text' name='name'><input type='submit'></form></html>"
   :status 200
   :content-type "text/html"
   })

(defn show-name
  "A response showing that we know the user's name"
  [name]
  {:body (str "Hello, " name)
   :cookies {"name" {:value name}} ; Preserve the cookies
   :status 200 })

(defn handler
  "If we know the user's name, show it; else, show a form to get it."
  [req]
  (let [name (or
              (get-in req [:cookies "name" :value])
              (get-in req [:params "name"]))]
    (if name
      (show-name name)
      (set-name-form))))

(def wrapped-handler
  (-> handler
      wrap-cookies
      wrap-params))

(defn -main []
  ;; Run the server on port 3000
  (jetty/run-jetty wrapped-handler {:port 3000}))

==== Discussion

This example uses the `wrap-cookies` and `wrap-params` middlewares
included with +ring-core+. The first time the user visits a page, it
shows the user a form for them to enter their name.  After their name
is entered, it stores their name in a cookie and displays it as a
instead, until the cookie is removed.

The example uses `wrap-cookies` to retrieve the user's stored name
from the cookie map, or if it's not there, `wrap-params` to retrieve
the user's name from the request parameters.

Ring's cookie middleware simply adds an extra parameter, `:cookies`,
onto the incoming request map, and sets any cookies you pass out as the
`:cookies` parameter on the response. The `:cookies` parameter is a
map that looks something like this:

[source, clojure]

{"name" {:value "Some Guy"}}

You can add other optional parameters to each cookie, along with `:value`. From the
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Cookies[Ring Cookie Documentation]:

[quote, Ring Docs]
____
As well as setting the value of the cookie, you can also set additional attributes:

* `:domain` - restrict the cookie to a specific domain
* `:path` - restrict the cookie to a specific path
* `:secure` - restrict the cookie to HTTPS URLs if true
* `:http-only` - restrict the cookie to HTTP if true (not accessible via e.g. JavaScript)
* `:max-age` - the number of seconds until the cookie expires
* `:expires` - a specific date and time the cookie expires
