=== Creating a List
[role="byline"]
by Luke VanderHart

==== Problem

You want to create a list data structure in your source code.((("composite data", "lists", id="ix_CDlist", range="startofrange")))((("Clojure", "clojure.lang.PersistentList")))(((lists, creating)))(((functions, list)))

==== Solution

There are two basic ways to specifically construct a list (a
+clojure.lang.PersistentList+).

You can use parentheses in combination with a single quote to indicate that
the list should only be read as a data structure, not immediately
evaluated:

[source,clojure]
----
'(1 :2 "3")
;; -> (1 :2 "3")
----

Or, more commonly, you can use the +list+ function, which takes a
variadic number of arguments and constructs a list from them:

[source,clojure]
----
(list 1 :2 "3")
;; -> (1 :2 "3")
----

==== Discussion

Typically, between these two approaches, using the +list+ function is
the better choice. The problem with constructing quoted lists is that
the quote also prevents evaluation of everything _inside_ the list,
which means that symbols will be returned as literal symbols, instead
of resolving variables or calling functions. +list+, however, will evaluate its
arguments in the normal way before constructing the list and is
usually what is desired for nonmacro code:

[source,clojure]
----
(def x 2)

'(1 x)
;; -> (1 x)

(list 1 x)
;; -> (1 2)
----

That said, +'()+ is the idiomatic way to create an empty list--it is
more terse, and the concern about evaluating its contents is
irrelevant when it's empty.

.Lists Versus Vectors
****

Clojure includes both list and vector types. Both are sequential data
structures. However, for most purposes, vectors are a better fit and
are more commonly used in idiomatic Clojure.(((lists, vs. vectors)))(((vectors, vs. lists)))

There are a couple of reasons for this. Vectors have a cleaner literal
syntax than lists and are just as space-efficient and performant. In
addition, vectors support near-constant lookup time by index
(_O_(log~32~ _n_)), as opposed to lists, which require linear time
(_O_(_n_)).

In general, the only reason to explicitly choose a list over a vector is
if you need a data structure that supports efficient insertions at
the beginning, which lists do; vectors are most efficient when
appending items to the end.
