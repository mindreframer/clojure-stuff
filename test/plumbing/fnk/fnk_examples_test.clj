;;; Input and output schemata

;; Input and output schemas describe the shape of nested maps with keyword keys
;; that are inputs and outputs of keyword functions, using the relevant
;; portions of the prismatic/schema library.

;; The structure of an input map is described using a nested map with keyword
;; keys, value schemas at the leaves, and (s/optional-key) for optional keys.

(def input-schema-1
  {(s/optional-key :a) s/Any
   :b s/Any
   :c {:c1 s/Any (s/optional-key :c2) s/Any}})

;; Fnk and graph understand only this subset of schema; additional constructs
;; are allowed, but fnk cannot 'see through' them to reason about their
;; semantics.

;; Output schemas are similar, except that the output schemas for Graphs
;; must consist of only required keys at the top level.

;;; Fnk

;; For our purposes, a keyword function is an ordinary clojure fn? that
;; accepts a nested map with keyword keys as input, whose 'leaves' are
;; arbitrary values (including maps with non-keyword keys), and returns
;; an arbitrary value.

;; In addition, a keyword function must respond to the pfnk/io-schemata
;; call, returning a pair of an input schema and output schema.
;; (fnks also carry general function schemas via prismatic/schema, and
;;  the pfnk/io-schemata protocol is just a convencience method on top of this).

;; We can manually define a simple fnk by attaching io-schemata metadata
;; to a fn satisfying the above properties:

(def a-manual-keyword-function
  (pfnk/fn->fnk
   (fn [{:keys [a b o] :or {o 10} :as m}]
     (assert (every? #(contains? m %) [:a :b]))
     {:x (+ a b o)})
   [{:a s/Any :b s/Any (s/optional-key :o) s/Any s/Keyword s/Any}
    {:x s/Any}]))


(defn test-simple-keyword-function [f]
  (is (= {:x 13}
         (f {:a 1 :b 2})))

  ;; for convience, you can also extract a pair of input and output scheams

  ;; or the input-schema or output-schema individually.
