=== Converting a Date to a Unix Timestamp
[role="byline"]
by Steven Proctor

==== Problem

You need to get a Unix timestamp representation for a +Date+ object.((("dates/times", "converting Unix timestamps")))(((timestamps)))

==== Solution

Many systems express timestamps in Unix time format, and when
you have to interact with these systems, you have to give them date
and time information in the format they desire.(((functions, to-unix-time)))

Fortunately, with Clojure's ability for nice interoperability with Java,
you have an easy solution at hand:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn to-unix-time
  "Returns a Unix time representation expressed in whole seconds
   given a java.util.Date."
  [date]
  (.getTime date))
----

This is how you can use the +to-unix-time+ function:

[source,clojure]
----
(def date (read-string "#inst \"2013-04-16T15:52:00.000-00:00\""))
;; -> #'user/date

(to-unix-time date)
;; -> 1366127520000
----

==== Discussion

When you have a http://bit.ly/javadoc-date[+java.util.Date+] object, you can use the Java interop
provided by Clojure as an easy way to get the time represented as a Unix
time.  Java's +Date+ objects have a method called +getTime+ that returns the
date as a Unix time.

If you are already using or wish to use the
https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time[+clj-time+] library, you can use +clj-time+
to obtain a Unix time&#x2013;formatted +DateTime+ object if you have a +DateTime+ object:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-time.coerce :as timec])

(defn datetime-to-unix-time
  "Returns a Unix time representation expressed in whole seconds
   given a DateTime."
  [datetime]
  (timec/to-long datetime))
----

And using the +datetime-to-unix-time+ function, you can see you get a
Unix time format for a +DateTime+ object:

[source,clojure]
----
(def datetime (clj-time.core/date-time 2013 04 16 15 52))
;; #'user/datetime

(datetime-to-unix-time datetime)
;; 1366127520000
----

Thanks to +clj-time.coerce+, all that is needed is to use the function
+to-long+ to get a Joda-Time +DateTime+ object into a Unix time format.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_PDdate")))


Your system may never need to interact with other systems that expect
timestamps expressed in Unix time, but if you are designing a system
that does, Clojure makes it very easy to express a +Date+ or +DateTime+ in
Unix time format.
