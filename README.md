Prismatic's Engineering Practices Sessions
=============
Every week, all the Prismatic engineers get together for an Eng Practices session.
We use it as a venue for us to each share our individual experience
and talk about how we can become better software engineers.
We've polished up some of our better discussions and released them here.
Hopefully you too will find them to be a useful tool for improving your craft.
